* ### 👶 Used very basic C that even a 5 year old will understand!
* ### 🤏 Whole code is just _under 170 lines_!

#### There are 2 versions of this -:
1. First version `sudoku_solver.c` takes input from user every time for each row and column. Quite tedious isn't it? So we introduced V2. Press `i` and enter values like `1 1 5` which is in format `row` `column` `value`.
2. V2 includes two ways through which you can enter the sudoku. First is the boring way of entering each value at every position like above. Second way is directly entering values `0 0 1 0 5 1 0 3 1` where `0` indicates empty value.
